## NetAP3 - NETworked Automated Program for Positions Placement

This is a learning project covering:

* modern Javascript and hopefully Typescript
* node ecosystem
* React
* Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) contract basics
* web3

Turns out the mechanics of programatic EVM are not that complicated,
just hidden behind complex terminology.

Don't use it for anything stupid.
